Happy to announce that I'm taking part in April's [Alan Turing Institute's Data Study](https://www.turing.ac.uk/events/data-study-group-april-2021) 
group. I'm excited to apply my knowledge and expertise to a real-world challenge starting next week 
and looking forward to meeting the other participants and partner organisations.
